Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Capstone project repository! This project is a simple game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. In this game, you control a turtle that needs to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. Here's how to play and run this game.

## Getting Started

To run the Turtle Crossing game on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x installed on your computer.
2. Ensure you have the Turtle graphics library installed.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-crossing.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username if you're forking the repository.

3. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:

## How to Play

- Use the `Up` arrow key to move the turtle north and try to cross the road.
- Dodge the moving cars and make it to the other side safely.
- The game continues until you get hit by a car.

## Game Features

- The game window has a 600x600-pixel size.
